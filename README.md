# rname
Command-line utility for convenient renaming of files.

## Usage
`$ rname <file>`

## Why does this repositoy exist?
I got tired of having to type long paths twice just to change the extension or a typo in some file's name.  
For example: `$ mv /very/long/path/to/some/file.txt /very/long/path/to/some/file.log`
